# Azure Storage Queue Demo - GAB2016 #

## Tools Used ##

Below are the tools I used in this Demo. Similar versions of Visual Studio and the Azure SDK should suffice, though there may be some limitations on the versions of Visual Studio you can use with the latest versions of the Azure SDK.

- Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition
- Azure SDK 2.8
- Azure Free Trial Subscription

You can also use the Azure Storage Emulator that is installed with the Azure SDK by using "UseDevelopmentStorage=true" in place of the Storage Account connection string rather than an actual Azure Subscription.

## Part 1

In this section we will be setting up a new project to connect to Azure Storage.
